# ======================================
# scenario: rolling-upgrade-node-alive-pre-gate-fails-b
# gates used: node_alive
#
# flow:
# 1. setup 3 independent nodes with ravendb 5.4
# 2. Deliberately sabotage node B (stop service)
# 3. try to rolling upgrade to 6.2 serially:
#   - roll A -> B -> C
#   - pre-gate node_alive
#   - upgrade the node to 6.2
#   - post-gate node_alive
#
# checkpoints:
# - A pre-gate passes
# - A post-gate passes
# - B pre-gate fails
# - C pre-gate is never reached
#
# outcome:
# - FAIL before upgrading B. A upgraded to 6.2; B/C remain 5.4
# - we catch the failure of pre-gate on B and stop the run
