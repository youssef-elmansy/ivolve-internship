# playbooks/setup_ravendb_secured_self_signed.yml
#
# Purpose: Install a RavenDB node secured with a self-signed certificate bundle
#
# What it does:
#   - Installs OS prerequisites (apt/yum)
#   - Detects distro/arch and downloads RavenDB (Ubuntu: DEB; others: tarball)
#   - Creates ravendb user/group and required directories
#   - Copies your provided server PFX + CA cert/key to the host
#   - extracts cert/key, fixes permissions, installs CA into system trust
#   - Installs license file
#   - Installs/updates binaries, writes systemd unit, sets CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
#   - Starts/enables the ravendb systemd service
#
# Notes:
#   - Provide the path to the ZIP via 'ravendb_setup_package'
#       * ravendb_certificate_file   -> server PFX (e.g., server.pfx)
#       * ravendb_ca_certificate_file -> CA PEM (public)
#       * ravendb_ca_key_file         -> CA private key (only if your flow needs it on node)
#   - The role **does not generate** certificates; it only installs what you supply.
#   - This playbook does not register client certs back on the controller for you; handle
#     client certificate distribution/registration separately.
#   - This is for self-signed-secured installs only. for LE-secured setup please refer to:  playbooks/setup_ravendb_secured.yml
