release_summary: |
  Release 2.1.1 fixes critical bugs including an AttributeError that occurred when updating commands or systems without providing all nested dictionary fields, and a check mode violation where excess commands were deleted even in check mode. Additionally, it enhances the output when commands are deleted to include their full configuration.

minor_changes:
  - "Enhance alpaca_command_set module to fetch and display complete command configuration in removed_commands output when commands are deleted, providing full details."

bugfixes:
  - "Fix critical AttributeError bug where 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' occurred when API returned None for nested dictionary fields. Applied safe pattern (.get('key') or {}) in modules alpaca_command_set.py, alpaca_command.py, and alpaca_system.py to prevent crashes during payload building and diff calculation."
  - "Fix critical check mode violation in alpaca_command_set.py where excess commands were deleted even in check mode."
