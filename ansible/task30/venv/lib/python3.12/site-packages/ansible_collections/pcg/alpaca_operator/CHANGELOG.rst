====================================================

.. contents:: Topics

v2.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Release 2.1.0 eliminates the external requests dependency, adds official support for Ansible 2.20, fixes documentation issues, and improves code quality through reduced duplication and consistent Python version requirements.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add ansible-core 2.20 to the CI/CD test matrix and officially support Ansible 2.20.
- Replace requests library dependency with ansible.module_utils.urls in _alpaca_api.py and alpaca_group.py to eliminate external dependency requirement.

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix inconsistent Python version requirement in module utils comment. Updated comment in _alpaca_api.py from Python 2.7+ to Python 3.8+ to match README.md and other documentation.
- Fix incorrect version_added values for parameters that were renamed from camelCase to snake_case in version 2.0.0. All renamed parameters now correctly show version_added: '2.0.0' instead of '1.0.0'.
- Refactor api_connection parameter documentation to use doc fragment and move argument spec to module utils to eliminate duplication across all modules.

v2.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Release 2.0.0 of the pcg.alpaca_operator collection addresses all feedback from the Ansible Collection Steering Committee review,
bringing the collection into full compliance with Ansible documentation standards and best practices.

Major Changes
-------------

- All module parameters/arguments now follow snake_case naming (e.g., 'apiConnection' is now 'api_connection', 'magicNumber' is now 'magic_number').
- Updated all module documentation, examples, and playbooks to reflect the new snake_case parameter names.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add best practices section for managing RFC passwords to maintain idempotency.
- Add comprehensive documentation in changelogs/fragments/README.md explaining how to create and manage changelog fragments.
- Add manual changelog generation script .dev/scripts/generate_changelog.sh for local testing and verification.
- Add requirements section to module documentation indicating minimum supported ALPACA Operator version.
- Document non-idempotent behavior of alpaca_system module when rfc_connection.password is specified.
- Introduce changelog fragment system using antsibull-changelog for automatic changelog generation from structured fragment files.
- Merge QUICK_START.md into index.md for consolidated getting started documentation.

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- Convert all Ansible module parameters from camelCase to snake_case to comply with Python and Ansible naming conventions. This is a breaking change that requires updating existing playbooks. API payload keys remain in camelCase as required by the ALPACA REST API.

Bugfixes
--------

- Add check_mode support documentation in attributes section and remove unsupported 'supports_check_mode' field from module documentation.
- Add missing periods to argument descriptions in module documentation to comply with Ansible documentation standards.
- Add semantic markup (V(), O(), M()) to module documentation descriptions for better readability and compliance with Ansible standards.
- Ensure Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCNs) are used for all plugins and modules, including ansible.builtin modules, in all documentation, examples, and return sections.
- Fix invalid documentation markup by using full paths for nested options in O() directives (e.g., O(command.agent_id)).
- Remove maximum version cap from requires_ansible field in meta/runtime.yml.
- Remove periods from return value descriptions in RETURN sections to comply with Ansible documentation standards.
- Replace 'Ansible' with 'ansible-core' in requirements fields and documentation to accurately reflect the dependency.
- alpaca_system - Fix TypeError by adding missing 'desired_vars' argument to build_variable_payload() function call.
