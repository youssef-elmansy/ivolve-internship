release_summary: |
  Release 2.0.0 of the pcg.alpaca_operator collection addresses all feedback from the Ansible Collection Steering Committee review,
  bringing the collection into full compliance with Ansible documentation standards and best practices.

breaking_changes:

major_changes:
  - "All module parameters/arguments now follow snake_case naming (e.g., 'apiConnection' is now 'api_connection', 'magicNumber' is now 'magic_number')."

minor_changes:
  - "Add requirements section to module documentation indicating minimum supported ALPACA Operator version."
  - "Merge QUICK_START.md into index.md for consolidated getting started documentation."
  - "Document non-idempotent behavior of alpaca_system module when rfc_connection.password is specified."
  - "Add best practices section for managing RFC passwords to maintain idempotency."
  - "Introduce changelog fragment system using antsibull-changelog for automatic changelog generation from structured fragment files."
  - "Add comprehensive documentation in changelogs/fragments/README.md explaining how to create and manage changelog fragments."
  - "Add manual changelog generation script .dev/scripts/generate_changelog.sh for local testing and verification."

bugfixes:
  - "Add missing periods to argument descriptions in module documentation to comply with Ansible documentation standards."
  - "Remove periods from return value descriptions in RETURN sections to comply with Ansible documentation standards."
  - "Add semantic markup (V(), O(), M()) to module documentation descriptions for better readability and compliance with Ansible standards."
  - "Replace 'Ansible' with 'ansible-core' in requirements fields and documentation to accurately reflect the dependency."
  - "Remove maximum version cap from requires_ansible field in meta/runtime.yml."
  - "Add check_mode support documentation in attributes section and remove unsupported 'supports_check_mode' field from module documentation."
  - "Ensure Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCNs) are used for all plugins and modules, including ansible.builtin modules, in all documentation, examples, and return sections."
  - "Fix invalid documentation markup by using full paths for nested options in O() directives (e.g., O(command.agent_id))."
  - "alpaca_system - Fix TypeError by adding missing 'desired_vars' argument to build_variable_payload() function call."

trivial:
  - "Add ansible-core 2.19 to the CI/CD test matrix."
